### ChangeDensity-win-batch

This is a windows batch script for changing tablets' screen density to the most comfortable point, in my case, 240dpi.

Use [wmCable](wmCable.bat) to change the density if you have a usb cable or you can try [wmCableless](wmCableless.bat) if you don't have any usb cable.

For some devices, we can modify the `ro.sf.lcd_density` in `/system/build.prop` to change the default screen density.
